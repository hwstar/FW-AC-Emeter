**FW AC E Meter**

This is firmware written in C which uses the Atmel 90E24 energy management chip
and an Atmel ATMEGA328P. It leverages u8glib to control a 128*64 graphics display.

Someone who knows what they are doing around hazardous mains voltages can use this code
as a starting point for a really nice AC energy meter:
