**FW AC E Meter**

This is firmware written in C which uses the Atmel 90E24 energy management chip
and an Atmel ATMEGA328P. It leverages u8glib to control a 128*64 graphics display.

Someone who knows what they are doing around hazardous mains voltages can use this code
as a starting point for a really nice AC energy meter. 

The hardware which this code runs on is not documented clearly enough to
be shared yet, and may not be documenented in the future as that is a lot
of work.
